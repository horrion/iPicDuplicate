# iPicDuplicate

This app was written when iOS was unable to duplicate pictures and videos "out of the box". 
Consider it obsolete as of 2017. 

The project compiles under iOS 6-10. Earlier versions might work, but are untested. 
API's in use require at least iPhone OS 3.1. To make it run on iOS 4.x and earlier, the app would have to be converted to use xib's instead of storyboards. 

iOS 7 and earlier Artwork is provided. 

Reset the app by pressing "Reset" or by shaking your device.
